# Compute units allocation [WIP]

\
## Goals

* Restrict the number of queries running in the Network.
* Encourage clients to obtain SQD tokens to use the Network.
* \*Guarantee that the Workers can handle the queries they receive.

## Solution

TODO: find a request limiting algorithm that doesnâ€™t limit the maximum capacity.

TODO: describe how the compute units are allocated and distributed to the Workers.
