# Repositories

## Server and Worker

This repository contains the nucleus of the portal/worker-side code
and for the Rust-side query planning library.


## DuckDB

[duckdb-extension-prototype](https://github.com/subsquid/duckdb-extension-prototype)

Prototype for the client-side DuckDB extension (based on the Postgres extension). 

## Trino

[trino-sqd](https://github.com/subsquid/trino-sqd)

Repository for Trino experiments based on a custom OpenAPI plugin for Trino.
Currently there is not much to see. I just manipulated the code to have a

* SQD catalog
* with a Solana schema
* with one table (node)
* and 3 rows in this table.
